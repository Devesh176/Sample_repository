# THE MINIONS 

## Problem Statement : The project aims to build a group of robots (starting with three or four),
## heterogenous or homogenous, combined, working on finishing a single task. All
## the robots will be locomotives enabled with efficient mechanical design, sensor
## fusion techniques, and communication protocols. This is a year-long project with
## the certainty of gaining excellent technical knowledge and a pinch of what
## robotics can offer to humanity!!.

## Our Approach : We are going to build homogenous omnidirectional robots, interacting using swarm algorithm.
## Initially we focus on centrallized swarm algorithm which means there will be a leader node that will give instructions to other nodes.
## The robot will be equipped with lidar, ultrasonic sensors, camera, bluetooth communication module along with jetson-nano, with planetary gear motors and mecannum wheels( for getting advantage of more degrees of freedom ).

# About the Team And CFI :


## Our Team is divided into mainly three modules 1.Software 2.Mechanincal and 3.Electrical .

# Software Module :
## The Software module people work on real-time simultion of robot using ros-noetic and gazebo, writitng the control and communication codes, working on the swarm optimisation algorithms, computer vision and localisation.
